                        <h3>Picture 1: Sky</h3>
                        <img src="img/2.jpg" alt="Sky" width="340" height="500">
                        <p>This right here marked the start of the painting. It took Bob Ross just under 6 minutes to
                            draw this, it took me about 10 times as long, before i was satisfied enough to move on. This
                            is, in my opinion, by far the best part about my painting.</p>

                        <h3>Picture 2: Mountains</h3>
                        <img src="img/3.jpg" alt="Sky" width="340" height="500">
                        <p>Afterwards, we moved on to the mountain. I had to revisit this area about three times
                            throughout the rest of the painting before i could actually say, these are mountains.
                            Definetly one of the more difficult parts to draw.</p>

                        <img src="img/4.jpg" alt="Sky" width="340" height="500">
                        <p>With the mountains finished, it was time to move on to one of Bobs favorites: Trees (and
                            bushes). Bushes looked very weird at the start but with enough paint on the brush and the
                            right movements, it was fine. They actually looke reasonably good as well.</p>

                        <h3>Picture 4: Foreground</h3>
                        <img src="img/5.jpg" alt="Sky" width="340" height="500">
                        <p>Continuing from the bushes and trees, we went on to tackle the foreground. Initially, I
                            though I would continue by making a larger lake that was visible until the very front, but
                            decided against that and carried on with the instructions Bob Ross gave me.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Picture 5: Finishing Touches</h3>
                        <img src="img/6.jpg" alt="Sky" width="340" height="500">
                        <p>Here I deviated the most from the original Painting. I tried for about 15 minutes to recreate
                            the shed that Bob Ross drew, but I made too many happy little accidents. So I decided
                            against it and just finished the painting off with some brighter trees in the foreground.

                        <h3>Picture 6: Messy Working Area</h3>
                        <img src="img/7.jpg" alt="Sky" width="340" height="500">
                        <p>This is what it looked like around my drawing area. It was messy. Not only my desk but also
                            my arms suffered many color attacks from my brushes and the canvas, but in the end, I was
                            victorious.</p>

                        "Bob Ross, in full Robert Norman Ross, (born October 29, 1942, Daytona Beach, Florida, U.S.—died July 4, 1995, New Smyrna Beach, Florida), American painter and television personality whose popular PBS television show The Joy of Painting (1983–94) made him a household name as the painting teacher to the masses."

                    </br>
                        "Ross projected a loveable hippie persona, sporting a permed afro and denim shirts and jeans and a soothing and intimate speaking voice that made the viewer feel as if it were a personal, one-on-one painting lesson. He also amazed viewers with his effortless painting method, creating detailed landscapes over the course of 30 minutes with the help of a housepainting brush and a palette knife, chatting and offering words of encouragement as he painted. Over the years, his folksy approach and references to “happy little” trees and clouds endeared him further to his fans. Ross went on to market his painting technique and establish a hugely successful company (Bob Ross Inc.) selling instructional books, videos, and a line of art supplies and offering painting workshops with teachers trained in his method, all of which continued to be profitable in the 21st century. He died of lymphoma at age 52."

                        "Interest in Ross had a resurgence in the 21st century with the availability of The Joy of Painting on such streaming platforms as YouTube. In 2020 the Smithsonian acquired two of Ross’s paintings as well as his easel, palette, and brushes and other objects related to The Joy of Painting for the American History Museum, Washington, D.C. That same year the Bob Ross Experience opened in Muncie, Indiana, where his show had been filmed. The museum included his studio and offered various workshops."
